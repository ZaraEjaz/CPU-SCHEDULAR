# CPU-SCHEDULER
This project demonstrates CPU scheduling and page replacement algorithms to enhance understanding of process management and memory usage in operating systems. By simulating these algorithms, it highlights their impact on system performance and efficiency.

# CPU Scheduling 

It is the process by which the system decides which task or process gets to use the CPU at any given time. The main objectives are maximizing CPU utilization, ensuring fair CPU time allocation, minimizing waiting time, and optimizing overall system throughput. Several algorithms are used to achieve these objectives, including:

# First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):
# Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF):
# Round Robin (RR):
# Priority Scheduling:
# Multilevel Queue Scheduling:

# Page Replacement

Page Replacement algorithms manage the contents of the memory by deciding which pages to swap out when a new page needs to be loaded. Effective page replacement is crucial to minimize page faults and enhance performance. Common page replacement algorithms include:

# First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
# Least Recently Used (LRU)
# Optimal Page Replacement
# Second Chance (Clock)
# Not Recently Used (NRU):
